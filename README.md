Welcome to the latest and greatest version of my website! Version 5 of my website comes with dramatically improved visuals, and the use of React under the hood.

I actually preferred writing my own framework, but the functionality of React Router was too alluring to resist. In version 4, every page had to be designed purely inside of markdown, but with React Router, each page can have unique content more applicable to the situiation. This did come with the bloat of having to use React, however. I may look into using other frameworks at a later date, especially when the view transition api becomes available for multi-page applications!

Currently, this website does not correctly support unique Discord embeds or Twitter cards for every page, unlike v4. It is not immediately obvious to me why React Helmet didn't work with Netlify's prerendering, but perhaps I will address it at a later date. 

I just wanted to get this version of the website out now as it has a far better user experience and is much more up to date than v4, which was released when I was 16. I have come a long way since then and I feel this website better reflects who I am.
